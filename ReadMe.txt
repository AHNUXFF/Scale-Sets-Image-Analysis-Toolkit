This is demo and free software provided by Dr. Zhongwen Hu, Shenzhen University.

The toolkit can be used for scale-sets based analysis of remote sensing images.

It can produced scale-sets hierarchy with very large images (ie. 20000*20000 pixels), however output
segmentation results of 4000*4000 pixles.

A demo is provided in the demo.pptx.
